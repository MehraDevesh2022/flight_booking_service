# This file maps commit authors with incorrect email addresses to their correct identities
# Format: Correct Name <correct@email> Incorrect Name <incorrect@email>
# 
# This helps Git (and GitHub) properly attribute commits to the right person
# even when the email address in historical commits has typos or variations.

# Map the typo email (gmial.com) to the correct email (gmail.com)
